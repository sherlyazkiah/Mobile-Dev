**Question 3:**

**Explain the function of the keywords yield*in the code!**

yield* is used inside an async generator function (async* function) to return all events from another stream directly.

Meaning:

- yield → sends one single value into the stream.

- yield* → sends all values from another stream, as if they were produced by this function itself.

**What does the content of the code command mean?**

The Stream.periodic(...) function creates a stream that generates data repeatedly every 1 second. The callback (int t) is executed each time the stream emits an event, where t acts as a counter that automatically increases from 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on every second. Inside the callback, int index = t % colors.length uses the modulo operator to ensure that the index cycles through the list of colors repeatedly without going out of bounds. The function then returns colors[index], producing a new color from the list every second. When combined with yield*, all colors generated by Stream.periodic() are forwarded directly as the output stream of the getColors() function within the ColorStream class.

**Question 4:**

The GIF shows the background changing colors every second based on the generated stream.
