# Practicum 1: Dart Streams

**Question 1:**

**Add your nickname to titlethe app as an identity for your work.**

**Question 2:**

**Add 5 more colors as you wish to colorsthe variable.**

**Question 3:**

**Explain the function of the keywords yield*in the code!**

yield* is used inside an async generator function (async* function) to return all events from another stream directly.

Meaning:

- yield → sends one single value into the stream.

- yield* → sends all values from another stream, as if they were produced by this function itself.

**What does the content of the code command mean?**

The Stream.periodic(...) function creates a stream that generates data repeatedly every 1 second. The callback (int t) is executed each time the stream emits an event, where t acts as a counter that automatically increases from 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on every second. Inside the callback, int index = t % colors.length uses the modulo operator to ensure that the index cycles through the list of colors repeatedly without going out of bounds. The function then returns colors[index], producing a new color from the list every second. When combined with yield*, all colors generated by Stream.periodic() are forwarded directly as the output stream of the getColors() function within the ColorStream class.

**Question 4:**

<img src="img\q4.gif" width="250" alt="1" />

The GIF shows the background changing colors every second based on the generated stream.

**Explain the difference between using listen and await for(step 9)!**

- listen attaches a listener callback to the Stream. It does not block the function. The program continues running while the callback is triggered every time the stream emits a new event. This is useful when we want the stream to run in the background and react to its events asynchronously.

- await for is used inside an async function to read events from a Stream sequentially. It waits for each event one at a time and blocks the function until the next event arrives. This makes the code easier to read and ensures the events are processed in order.
