Practical Assignments

**1. Complete Practicals 1 and 2, then document and upload screenshots of each work result along with explanations in a file README.md! If there are any errors or code that doesn't work, please correct them according to the application's purpose!**

**Practical 1**

<img src="src/kamera.gif">

In this practical 1, the app created to access the device’s camera and take photos using the camera plugin.

**Practical 2**

<img src="src/filter.gif">

In this practical 2, a carousel of image filters created to allow user to apply different color filters to a photo.

**2. Combine the results of lab 1 with the results of lab 2 so that after taking the photo, you can create a carousel filter!**

After combined both practical into one app:

- User takes a photo using the camera.

- After the photo is captured, it automatically opens the Filter Carousel screen.

- User can scroll through filters to apply different effects to the captured image.

**3. Explain the purpose void asyncof practical 1?**

"async" allows a function to perform asynchronous operations, meaning it can wait for tasks that take time (like opening the camera or saving a file) without freezing the app’s UI. It works together with the await keyword to pause the function until a task finishes.

**4. Explain the function of annotation @immutableand @override?**

@immutable in Flutter indicates that a class’s state cannot be modified once it has been created. It is typically used with StatelessWidget classes, where all properties of the class are declared as final.

@override tells the compiler that the method redefines (overrides) a method from its parent class.

**5. Submit your GitHub repository commit link to the agreed lecturer!**
